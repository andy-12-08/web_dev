I want to go to the market and get the following items:
<ul>
    <li>Milk</li>
    <li>Donuts</li>
    <li>Cookies</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Chocolate</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Peanut Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Pepto Bismol</li>
</ul>
This should be enough for me to get the necessary ingredients <br>
to  make a delicious meal for lunch.
