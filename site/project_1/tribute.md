### In this project, I designed a simple web page using HTML and CSS. This project made me understand the importance of division element in specifying different parts of the web page for ease of styling.
### A few take home here are:
- While adjusting the distance between elments, first add padding (in all four directions) and preview, then go ahead to add the right set of padding distances before adding your margin. <br>

- To centralize a group of text under a given division element (a very important block elment), explore adjusting the width, aligning, ad most importantly; relative position specification. <br>

- Also try as much as possible to keep your work neat.

- To avoid bolding your text, you can start a new line with the p element (a block element)
